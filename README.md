# Scaler-Clustering-Case-Study

( Concepts Used :
  - Manual Clustering
  - Unsupervised Clustering - K- means, Hierarchical Clustering )

Problem Statement -

Scaler, an online tech-versity offering advanced computer science and data science courses, aims to provide learners with personalized career guidance. To achieve this, understanding the landscape of companies and job positions from the Scaler database is essential.

As a data scientist in Scalerâ€™s analytics vertical, your task is to analyze learner data and cluster them based on their job profiles, companies, and other relevant attributes. The objective is to create meaningful clusters where individuals within a cluster share similar characteristics.

These clusters will help Scaler identify patterns and provide data-driven insights for career counseling, mentorship programs, and targeted upskilling recommendations.

Key concepts applied in this project include:

Manual Clustering for initial data exploration and validation

Unsupervised Clustering using techniques such as K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering

The goal is to generate actionable insights that enhance learner outcomes and foster successful career placements.
